starting:
[0.60, 0.40], [0.80, 0.45]
[0.80, 0.45], [0.70, 0.50]
[0.70, 0.50], [0.60, 0.40]

correct: (generates triangles in the right direction)
[0.60, 0.40], [0.52, 0.18]
[0.60, 0.40], [0.75, 0.23]

incorrect:
[0.60, 0.40], [0.51, 0.59]
[0.51, 0.59], [0.70, 0.50]
[0.70, 0.50], [0.84, 0.65]
[0.84, 0.65], [0.80, 0.45]

clockwise triangle creation works; all triangles are clockwise
however direction of perpendicularity is faulty
